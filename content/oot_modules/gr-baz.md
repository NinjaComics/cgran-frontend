gr-baz is a GNU Radio project that adds new functionality (blocks, GRC
definitions, apps, etc). It uses the standard GNU Radio block source tree
layout and build process.

Part of the new functionality makes it easier to analyse signals. For example,
performing cyclostationary analyis (see Variable Delay block below) and Fast
Auto-correlation.
